# Pull Request Review Implementation Skill

This skill helps you systematically implement code review feedback from GitHub pull requests, ensuring quality through automated validation.

## What this skill does

- Fetches review comments from a specific GitHub pull request
- Categorizes feedback by severity and type
- Discusses implementation priorities with the user
- Implements approved changes
- Validates changes through comprehensive testing
- Creates atomic commits for implemented feedback

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when you:
- Receive code review feedback on a pull request
- Need to address reviewer comments systematically
- Want to ensure changes don't introduce regressions
- Need guidance on prioritizing review feedback

## How to use this skill

### Step 1: Identify the Pull Request

**Determine which PR to review:**
- Check for active pull request in repository context
- Ask user for PR number if not evident
- Verify PR exists and has review comments

**Required information:**
- Repository owner (e.g., "ytkaczyk")
- Repository name (e.g., "ai-ocr")
- Pull request number (e.g., 35)

### Step 2: Fetch Review Comments

**Use GitHub MCP tools to get feedback:**

```typescript
// TypeScript function signature for the MCP tool
declare function mcp_github_pull_request_read(params: {
  method: "get_review_comments" | "get_reviews";
  owner: string;
  repo: string;
  pullNumber: number;
}): Promise<unknown>;

// Usage examples:
// Get review comments (line-specific feedback)
await mcp_github_pull_request_read({
  method: "get_review_comments",
  owner: "ytkaczyk",
  repo: "ai-ocr",
  pullNumber: 35,
});

// Get general reviews (approval, changes requested, comments)
await mcp_github_pull_request_read({
  method: "get_reviews",
  owner: "ytkaczyk",
  repo: "ai-ocr",
  pullNumber: 35,
});
```

### Step 3: Analyze and Categorize Feedback

**Organize feedback by priority:**

1. **Critical Issues** (🔴 Must Fix)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Logic errors that cause bugs
   - Race conditions or memory leaks
   - Breaking changes

2. **Important Issues** (🟡 Should Fix)
   - Performance problems
   - Dead code or unused imports
   - Missing error handling
   - Type safety issues

3. **Suggestions** (🟢 Nice to Have)
   - Code style improvements
   - Refactoring opportunities
   - Additional test coverage
   - Documentation enhancements

4. **Won't Fix** (⚪ Defer or Ignore)
   - Out of scope for current PR
   - Disagree with recommendation (document why)
   - Planned for separate PR

**Present analysis to user:**
```
Found 6 review comments:

Critical (2):
- [Gemini] TTL race condition on in-flight requests
- [Copilot] Response cloning bug in cache

Important (3):
- [Copilot] Dead code (request-cache.ts unused)
- [Copilot] Cleanup race condition
- [Copilot] JSON.stringify cache key unreliability

Suggestions (1):
- [Copilot] Add test coverage for new utilities

Which items should I implement?
```

### Step 4: Confirm Implementation Plan

**Discuss with user:**
- Which feedback items to address
- Whether to group related changes
- If any feedback should be deferred

**Example dialogue:**
```
User: "Address the critical and important issues, defer test coverage"
Assistant: "I'll implement 5 issues and create commits. The test coverage 
            suggestion will be tracked separately."
```

### Step 5: Implement Changes

**Apply changes based on feedback:**

1. **Analyze root cause** - Understand why the issue exists
2. **Consider alternatives** - Multiple ways to fix?
3. **Choose simplest solution** - Prefer deletion over addition
4. **Make focused changes** - One logical fix at a time

**Implementation strategies:**

- **For dead code**: Delete it entirely (simplest fix)
- **For bugs**: Fix root cause, not symptoms
- **For performance**: Optimize without over-engineering
- **For style**: Follow existing patterns in codebase

**Example from PR #35:**
```
Feedback: "request-cache.ts is unused dead code with multiple bugs"
Analysis: File never imported, adds complexity for no benefit
Solution: Delete entire file (addresses ALL related issues at once)
Result: -70 lines, 6 review comments resolved
```

### Step 6: Validate Changes

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL validation steps must pass before committing code.**

Run the complete validation suite in order. **Do NOT skip any step. Do NOT commit until all 4 steps pass.**

**1. Build verification (REQUIRED):**
```bash
npm run build
```
- Ensures TypeScript compiles
- Catches type errors
- Verifies production bundle builds
- **Must complete with 0 errors**

**2. Lint verification (REQUIRED):**
```bash
npm run lint
```
- Enforces code style
- Catches common mistakes
- Ensures best practices
- **Must complete with 0 warnings**

**3. Unit tests (REQUIRED):**
```bash
npm run test
```
- Validates individual functions
- Tests edge cases
- Ensures logic correctness
- **All tests must pass**

**4. End-to-end tests (REQUIRED):**
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
- Tests full user workflows
- Validates integration
- Catches UI/UX regressions
- **All tests must pass**

**Validation checklist (ALL must be checked before committing):**
- [ ] Build passes without errors ✓
- [ ] Lint passes with 0 warnings ✓
- [ ] All unit tests pass ✓
- [ ] All e2e tests pass ✓
- [ ] No new errors in console (if applicable)

**⚠️ If ANY step fails:**
1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run ALL validation steps from the beginning
3. Only proceed to commit when all 4 steps pass

### Step 7: Create Atomic Commits

**Only proceed to this step after ALL validation steps pass (build, lint, test, test:e2e).**

**Follow conventional commit format:**

```bash
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "<type>: <description>

<body explaining why and what>

Addresses review feedback:
- <specific comment 1>
- <specific comment 2>"
```

**Commit types:**
- `fix`: Bug fixes from review feedback
- `refactor`: Code improvements without changing behavior
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `docs`: Documentation updates

**Example commit:**
```
refactor: remove unused request caching code

- Delete request-cache.ts as it's not used anywhere
- Remove fetchFn parameter from RetryOptions (never utilized)
- Simplify DEFAULT_OPTIONS type back to Required<RetryOptions>

Addresses PR review feedback:
- Dead code (request-cache.ts unused)
- Response cloning bugs in cache implementation
- Race conditions in TTL and cleanup logic
- JSON.stringify cache key reliability issues
- Missing test coverage for unused features
```

### Step 8: Update Pull Request

**Push changes and notify reviewers:**

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**Mark resolved review threads:**

After implementing feedback, mark the corresponding review conversations as resolved. This helps reviewers track what's been addressed.

**For each implemented review comment:**
1. Identify the review thread ID from the fetched comments
2. Mark as resolved if the feedback was fully implemented

**Add summary comment to PR:**
```markdown
Addressed review feedback:

✅ Critical: TTL race condition (resolved by removing unused code)
✅ Important: Dead code and related bugs (removed request-cache.ts)
⏳ Deferred: Test coverage (will address in separate PR)

All quality gates passing:
- Build: ✓
- Lint: ✓
- Unit tests: ✓
- E2E tests: ✓

Marked 5 review threads as resolved.
```

**Important**: Only mark threads as resolved when you've actually addressed the feedback. If you're deferring or disagreeing, leave them open and add an explanatory comment instead.

## Best Practices

### Always Analyze Before Implementing

**Don't blindly apply feedback.** Understand:
- Why the reviewer flagged it
- What problem it causes
- Whether the suggested solution is best

Sometimes the best fix is different from what's suggested.

### Group Related Changes

**Create atomic commits** that represent single logical changes:
- Fix for specific bug → one commit
- Removal of dead code → one commit
- Performance optimization → one commit

Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit.

### Consider Scope

**Not all feedback must be addressed immediately:**
- **In scope**: Directly related to PR changes
- **Out of scope**: New features or unrelated improvements
- **Separate PR**: Large refactors that deserve own review

Be transparent about what you're deferring and why.

### Validate Thoroughly

**Run ALL quality gates before pushing - no exceptions:**

**The 4 Required Steps (in order):**
1. `npm run build` - Must succeed with 0 errors
2. `npm run lint` - Must pass with 0 warnings
3. `npm run test` - All unit tests must pass
4. `npm run test:e2e` - All e2e tests must pass

**⚠️ NEVER:**
- Skip any validation step
- Commit before running all 4 steps
- Assume "it will probably work"
- Say "I'll run tests after committing"

**If a step fails:**
- Fix the issue immediately
- Re-run ALL steps from the beginning
- Only commit when all 4 steps pass

Validation is not optional - it's the safety net that prevents breaking production.

### Communicate Clearly

**When marking conversations resolved:**
- Only resolve when feedback is fully addressed
- Add comment explaining the fix before resolving
- Leave open if deferring (explain why in comment)

**When deferring feedback:**
- Explain why (out of scope, needs more research, etc.)
- Create tracking issue if significant
- Thank reviewer for catching it

**When disagreeing with feedback:**
- Explain your reasoning respectfully
- Provide context reviewer might not have
- Be open to discussion

### Learn from Patterns

**Notice recurring feedback types:**
- Same mistake across files → update your mental checklist
- Tool-specific issues → consider automation
- Style violations → update linter config

Use feedback to improve future code quality.

## Common Review Feedback Patterns

### Pattern: Dead Code

**Feedback**: "This code is unused"

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Search for imports
grep -r "import.*fileName" .

# Search for function usage  
grep -r "functionName" .
```

**Action**: Delete if truly unused. Dead code adds maintenance burden.

### Pattern: Race Conditions

**Feedback**: "This has a race condition when..."

**Investigation:**
- Trace async operations
- Check timing dependencies
- Look for shared mutable state

**Solutions:**
- Proper Promise chaining
- Lock mechanisms
- Immutable data structures

### Pattern: Type Safety Issues

**Feedback**: "This should have stricter types"

**Examples:**
```typescript
// Weak typing
const data: any = fetchData();

// Better typing
const data: UserProfile = fetchData();
```

**Action**: Add proper types, avoid `any` unless necessary.

### Pattern: Performance Issues

**Feedback**: "This causes unnecessary re-renders"

**React-specific checks:**
- Are objects/arrays recreated each render?
- Should values be memoized?
- Are dependencies specified correctly?

**Solutions:**
```typescript
// Memoize expensive computations
const value = useMemo(() => compute(data), [data]);

// Memoize callbacks
const handler = useCallback(() => doSomething(), []);
```

### Pattern: Missing Error Handling

**Feedback**: "What happens if this fails?"

**Add appropriate handling:**
```typescript
// Before
const data = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json());

// After
try {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Fetch failed', error);
  throw error; // or return default value
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails After Changes

**Check:**
- Did you introduce syntax errors?
- Are all imports still valid?
- Did you break type contracts?

**Fix:**
```bash
# See detailed error
npm run build 2>&1 | less

# Check specific file
npx tsc --noEmit <file.ts>
```

### Tests Fail After Changes

**Investigate:**
- Which tests are failing?
- What changed in those code paths?
- Are test assumptions still valid?

**Don't just update tests to pass** - understand WHY they're failing.

### Lint Errors

**Common causes:**
- Unused imports (remove them)
- Console statements (use proper logging)
- Hook rule violations (move hooks before conditions)

**Fix systematically:**
```bash
# Auto-fix what's possible
npm run lint -- --fix

# Manually fix remaining issues
```

### E2E Tests Flaky

**Possible causes:**
- Timing issues (add proper waits)
- State pollution between tests
- Network conditions

**Improve stability:**
```typescript
// Wait for specific conditions
await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="loaded"]');

// Don't use arbitrary timeouts
// await page.waitForTimeout(1000); // ❌

// Use deterministic waits
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle'); // ✓
```

## Example: Full Workflow

### Scenario: PR #35 Review Implementation

**Step 1**: Identify PR
```
PR: #35 "Remove extra api calls"
Repo: ytkaczyk/ai-ocr
Branch: remove-extra-api-calls
```

**Step 2**: Fetch comments
```
Found 6 review comments from Gemini and Copilot
```

**Step 3**: Analyze
```
Critical (2): TTL race condition, Response cloning bug
Important (3): Dead code, cleanup races, cache key issues
Suggestions (1): Missing test coverage
```

**Step 4**: Confirm with user
```
User: "Implement all, prioritize fixing the bugs"
```

**Step 5**: Implement
```
Analysis: request-cache.ts is unused AND has all the bugs
Solution: Delete entire file (fixes all issues at once)
Also: Remove unused fetchFn parameter from retry.ts
```

**Step 6**: Validate (ALL REQUIRED)
```bash
npm run build     # ✓ Pass (0 errors)
npm run lint      # ✓ Pass (0 warnings)
npm run test      # ✓ Pass (464 tests)
npm run test:e2e  # ✓ Pass (all workflows)
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: All 4 validation steps completed successfully before proceeding to commit.

**Step 7**: Commit
```bash
git rm lib/utils/request-cache.ts
git add lib/utils/retry.ts
git commit -m "refactor: remove unused request caching code

- Delete request-cache.ts as it's not used anywhere
- Remove fetchFn parameter (never utilized)
- Addresses all 6 review comments by removing problematic code"
```

**Step 8**: Push
```bash
git push origin remove-extra-api-calls
```

**Step 9**: Mark conversations as resolved
```
Marked 6 review threads as resolved (all addressed by removing dead code)
Added summary comment to PR explaining what was fixed
```

**Result**: All review feedback addressed with a single, clean commit that removes complexity rather than adding patches.

## Related Skills

- **commit**: Create properly formatted atomic commits
- **troubleshoot**: Debug issues found during validation
- Use after implementing changes to ensure proper version control

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Fetch PR review comments
mcp_github_pull_request_read get_review_comments ...
mcp_github_pull_request_read get_reviews ...

# Validate changes (ALL REQUIRED - NO EXCEPTIONS)
npm run build      # ✓ Must pass
npm run lint       # ✓ Must pass
npm run test       # ✓ Must pass
npm run test:e2e   # ✓ Must pass

# Only after ALL validation passes:
git add <files>
git commit -m "<type>: <description>"
git push origin <branch>
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: Never commit without running all 4 validation steps first.**

**Remember**: The goal is not just to satisfy reviewers, but to improve code quality. Sometimes the best response to feedback is "good catch, but here's a better solution."
